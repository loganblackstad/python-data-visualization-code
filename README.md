# Data Visualizations in Python (with matplotlib)

Creating visualizations of your data helps make your analysis clearer and easier to understand, especially with larger, high dimensional datasets. At the end of your project, it’s important to be able to present your final results in a clear, concise, and compelling manner that your audience (esp. non-technical clients) can understand.

Matplotlib is a popular Python library that can be used to create your Data Visualizations quite easily. However, setting up the data, parameters, figures, and plotting can get quite messy and tedious to do every time you do a new project. In this blog post, we’re going to look at 5 data visualizations and write some quick and easy functions for them with Python’s Matplotlib:

### Plot Types:
- Scatter Plots
- Line Plots
- Histograms
- Bar Plots
- Box Plots
